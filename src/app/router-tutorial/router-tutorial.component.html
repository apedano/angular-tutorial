            <p> The <code>app.module.ts</code> is the place where we add <b>Routes</b></p>

            Then we have to register the routes in the application <code>@NgModule</code>

                <code>{{snippet2}}</code>
             </pre>
             by doing that we register our defines routes to the router engine of Angular.

        <div class="notes">
            Then we have to define where we want our routed componets to be rendered in our application.
            we add the <code>router-outlet</code> tag in that place

            We can add navigation links in our components (as in the tabs in the navigation of the AppComponent)     
            one case is to simply add the path to an anchor element

         <div class="notes"> We should use a dedicated directive instead, <span class="warning">which used absolute and relative paths</span> </div>

            The directive (can be used within the anchor element itself or also outside) will add the css class in the input to the element if the corresponding link is active

            <code>{{snippet5}}</code>

         <div class="notes">This will always make the link to '/' home active because it is done via matching (contains) the current path with the associated link. With the following configuration we force the exact match</div>
